# Text-Generation using with Python and TensorFlow/Keras

(Text Generation using a Recurrent Neural Networks, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory Network, implementing this network in Python, and use it to generate some text.)

To begin with, let's start by defining our terms:-
\n**TensorFlow**:

TensorFlow is one of the most commonly used machine learning libraries in Python, specializing in the creation of deep neural networks. Deep neural networks excel at tasks like image recognition and recognizing patterns in speech. TensorFlow was designed by Google Brain, and its power lies in its ability to join together many different processing nodes.
